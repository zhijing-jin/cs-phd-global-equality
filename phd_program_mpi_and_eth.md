# Tips on PhD Applications with Max Planck Institute and/or ETH in AI

Last updated: Dec 7, 2021 by Zhijing Jin.

## Diverse List of Programs
There are many programs to apply for if you want to work with Max Planck Institute (MPI) and/or ETH.

Below is a subset of them that I am familiar with:

1. (Often by end of Nov) [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/apply)

2. (Often by Nov~Dec) [Cambridge – Tübingen PhD Fellowships in Machine Learning](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?page_id=659), e.g., [this call](https://www.is.mpg.de/jobs/cambridge-tubingen-phd-fellowships-in-machine-learning)
3. (Often by Nov 15) ELLIS PhD Program, e.g., [this call for 2022](https://twitter.com/ELLISforEurope/status/1564962787335585792)
4. (Often by Nov 1) PhD with [International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/application)
5. (Any time of the year) Interview directly with MPI you are interested in, and then the admin can involve you in [International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/application), or your degree can also come from a local university near your MPI, e.g., University of Tuebingen.
6. (Often by Dec 15) [ETH Direct Doctorate in Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/doctorate/direct-doctorate-computer-science.html)
7. (Often by Nov 30) [ETH AI Center PhD](https://ai.ethz.ch/education/phd-and-postdoc-programs.html#par_textimage_1068285857)
8. (Open any time of the year) [PhD application to ETH CS](https://inf.ethz.ch/doctorate/doctoral-studies/application-and-admission.html)
9. (Open any time of the year) [PhD application to MPI Tuebingen with Prof Bernhard Schoelkopf](https://ei.is.mpg.de/jobs/phd) and [postdoc](https://ei.is.mpg.de/jobs//postdoc)

## Suggestions
1. Always interact with the profs (often by letting your personal recommenders email your target profs), and make sure they would like to accept you
2. You can always browse through their existing PhDs to see which program they applied through, and what backgrounds they had before applying
3. If you have >1 year before you apply, you can always feel free to do a remote research project with the PhDs by emailing them your CV, and how matched you are with their existing research directions.

Good luck!
