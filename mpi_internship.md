If you are interested in a research internship for 3-12 months (with an end date before Sept 1, 2025), we can host research interns at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tuebingen, Germany. 

- **Affiliation:** [Empirical Inference department](https://ei.is.mpg.de/), hosted under [Zhijing Jin](https://zhijing-jin.com/) and Prof Bernhard Schoelkopf.

- **Topics:** 
  - Causal Inference with LLMs (check our [CLadder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04350) and [CausalQuest](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20318) papers)
  - Simulacra to create a society of multiple LLM agents: Check our [GovSim](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16698) paper, and we are interested in many followup studies.
  - Or also open to other research directions, ideally for socially responsible LLMs

## How to Apply

Step 1. Fill out the application forms on Zhijing's website: https://zhijing-jin.com. 

Step 2. If your application is relevant, you will receive contacts, either by an email or a direct calendar invite in 7-14 days, usually.

Step 3. After research chats and confirmation of interests, we will start setting up the internship logistics, with visa processing, if needed. If you will need a visa and know that it will take a long time, we suggest to apply early to us so that we can kick off Step 1 and 2 early.



Thank you again for your interest! We look forward to your application.
