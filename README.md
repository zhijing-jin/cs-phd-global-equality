# Resources to Help Global Equality for PhDs in NLP / AI

This repo originates with a wish to promote **Global Equality** for people who want to do a PhD in NLP, following the idea that mentorship programs are an effective way to fight against segregation, according to [The Human Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C5jrYlVHJQ&t=1753s) (Jackson, 2019). Specifically, we wish people from all over the world and with all types of backgrounds can share the same source of information,
so that success will be a reward to those who are determined and hardworking, regardless of external contrainsts.

One non-negligible reason for success is **access to information**, such as (1) knowing what a PhD in NLP is like, (2) knowing what top grad schools look for when reviewing PhD applications, (3) broadening your horizon of what is _good work_, (4) knowing how careers in NLP in both academia and industry are, and many others.

### Prereq: Getting the Tools Ready

#### Where Do I Get GPU Computing Resources?

2. For more computationally intensive projects, you can apply to AWS with [credits for research](https://pages.awscloud.com/aws-cloud-credit-for-research.html).
3. For general computational needs, you can use a Digitalocean droplet (5-10$ per month), and run your ubuntu machine with any service for some time.

####  Improve Your Proficiency with Tools

1. (MIT 2020) **The Missing Semester of Your CS Education** (e.g., master the command-line, ssh into remote machines, use fancy features of version control systems).

       <br>Takeaways: Writing the Introduction section and giving talks can also be like telling a Hollywood story: the setting (what problem we are solving; how important it is), the villian (how difficult this problem is; how previous work cannot solve it well), and the superhero (what we propose). For giving talks, starting with personal stories (e.g., a story of grandma telling the kid not to drink and persist the right thing leading to the person's life pursuit on social justice) is very helpful to get the audience involved.

   <br>Interesting snippets: "Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity.", "One of the chief tricks is to live a long time!", "I made the resolution that I would never again solve an isolated problem except as characteristic of a class.".

   <br> _Interesting snippets: "Goal-driven. Develop a vision of some new AI capabilities you’d like to achieve, and solve problems that bring you closer to that goal.", "If you are working on incremental ideas, be aware that their usefulness depends on their complexity.", "Consider how the biggests bursts of impactful work tend to be tightly clustered in a small number of research groups and institutions. That’s not because these people are dramatically smarter than everyone else, it’s because they have a higher density of expertise and perspective, which puts them a little ahead of the rest of the community, and thus they dominate in generating new results.", "Early on in your career, I recommend splitting your time about evenly between textbooks and papers. You should choose a small set of relevant textbooks and theses to gradually work through, and you should also reimplement the models and algorithms from your favorite papers."_

3. (Prof Fei-Fei Li@Stanford) **De-Mystifying Good Research and Good Papers** (2014). [[Suggestions](https://bigaidream.gitbooks.io/tech-blog/content/2014/de-mystifying-good-research.html)]
   <br>_Interesting snippets: "This means publishing papers is NOT about “this has not been published or written before, let me do it”, nor is it about “let me find an arcane little problem that can get me an easy poster”. It’s about “if I do this, I could offer a better solution to this important problem,” or “if I do this, I could add a genuinely new and important piece of knowledge to the field.” You should always conduct research with the goal that it could be directly used by many people (or industry). In other words, your research topic should have many ‘customers’, and your solution would be the one they want to use. A good research project is not about the past (i.e. obtaining a higher performance than the previous N papers). It’s **about the future (i.e. inspiring N future papers to follow and cite you, N->\inf)**."_

   <br>_Interesting snippets: "“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.” Underlying all our habits are models (often unconscious) of how the world works. I’m writing this essay to develop an improved personal model of how to be an effective researcher, a model that can be used as the basis for concrete actions leading to the development of new habits.", "Make sure you’re fit. Look after your health. Spend high quality time with your family. Have fun. These things require a lot of thought and effort to get right.", "Develop a high-quality research environment", "Developing a taste for what’s important: What do you think are the characteristics of important science? What makes one area thrive, while another dies away? What sorts of unifying ideas are the most useful? What have been the most important developments in your field? **Why are they important?** What were the apparently promising ideas that didn’t pan out? Why didn’t they pan out? You need to be thinking constantly about these issues, both in concrete terms, and also in the abstract, developing both a general feeling for what is important (and what is not), and also some specific beliefs about what is important and what is not in your fields of interest.", "occasionally set time aside to survey the landscape of a field, looking not just for problems, but trying to identify larger patterns. What types of questions do people in the field tend to ask? **Can we abstract away patterns in those questions?** What other fields might there be links to? What are the few most important problems in the field?"_
